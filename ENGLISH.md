Last week, i went to America. On monday I packed my things and left home early to avoid a traffic jams. I arrived to airport too early so I waited for the flight in the departure lounge.

On the plane I settled into my seat, fastened my seat belt and fell asleep. After we landed I drove straight to my hotel. I left my stuff there and went sightseeing.

I was overwhelmed with all of interesting things and places that I almost missed my bus to the train station. I made it to platform just in time.

It was a great holiday.
